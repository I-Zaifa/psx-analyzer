Built a full analysis dashboard for the Pakistan Stock Exchange.

606 stocks. 37 sectors. 16 years of daily data. Every metric computed from scratch — CAGR, Sharpe, beta, drawdown, volatility, the works.

The whole pipeline pulls live data from PSX's data portal, Yahoo Finance, World Bank, and FRED. Computes everything in Python. Exports to a static site you can host anywhere for free.

What it does:
- Stock screener across all 600+ listed companies
- Individual stock pages with price charts, moving averages, drawdown, benchmark comparison
- Sector treemap and rankings
- Side-by-side comparison for up to 5 stocks
- Macro overlays — KSE-100, USD/PKR, CPI, SBP policy rate
- Full methodology and source code available on-site

All the data, all the code, all the math — open and downloadable.

Not financial advice. Just a tool I wanted to exist.
